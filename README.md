# InteractiveFractalGenerator
Math Project I made in sophomore year, written purely in Java. So far it can generate a fractal tree, where the angles and length can be altered via sliders.

To open this program, download and run the jar file only

I may add other fractals later, including the carpet or snowflake fractals
